# sven-blog
A small compiled blog intended to be hosted by some free pages somewhere. Probably on GitHub pages.
Built with Hexo, currently using Cactus dark theme with some modified shenanigans going on that make it more visually appealing to me.

## Branches
This is the main branch that contains the compiled pages. God forbid if you wanted to replicate my blog, you'll want to navigate to the src branch.

## Getting There
If I've done my job right, you can see the finished result at https://sven.ai.

## Contribution
Odd shout but I always take suggestions or feedback on the setup, styling, and plugins used here.
