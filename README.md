# sven-blog
A small compiled blog intended to be hosted by some free pages somewhere. Probably on GitHub pages.
Built with Hexo, currently using Cactus dark theme with some modified shenanigans going on that make it more visually appealing to me.

## Branches
This is the src branch that contains the configuration and raw markdown used to generate the blog and its posts.

## Getting There
If I've done my job right, you can see the finished result at https://sven.ai.

## Contribution
Odd shout but I always take suggestions or feedback on the setup, styling, and plugins used here.
