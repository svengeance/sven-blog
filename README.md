# sven-blog
A small compiled blog intended to be hosted by some free pages somewhere. Probably on GitHub pages.
Built with Astro/Fuwari.

## Branches
This is the main branch that contains the compiled pages. God forbid if you wanted to replicate my blog, you'll want to navigate to the src branch.

## Getting There
If I've done my job right, you can see the finished result at https://sven.ai.

## Contribution
Odd shout but I always take suggestions or feedback on the setup, styling, and plugins used here.
