# 3'rd Time's the Charm

If you're curiously investigative to search the commit history of a blog, this one has gone through three iterations - Hugo, Hexo, and finally Astro. 

I wasn't a fan of static site generators written either in Go or Ruby (Jekyll). Astro's structure reminds me of Nuxt, which I fell in love with when working with Vue. All in all, it took a couple of hours to read enough about it, scope out a suitable theme, and get'r up and running.

## Plans
As I work to transition from a senior into a principal engineer (and beyond), my goal is to use this blog as an outlet to refine my thoughts. It takes skill to be able to feel out elegant approaches to programming, people, and architecture problems, but it takes patience and experience to rationally communicate those feelings in a sane way.
