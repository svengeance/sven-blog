# Future Posts
The below lists represents topics that are interesting to me personally, which I will pursue writing in the future.

### Establish a Domain
One of the common criticisms of any software blog is that it's hard to discern the veracity of thought lines when their only proof lies in contrived examples. _Yes_, your beautiful post on ✨Business Test Domain Driven Design on Hypoallergenic Immaculate Scalable Architecture✨ may work for your calculator, but I have to write features that are stretched and contorted by a seemingly innumerable amount of business rules.

I'd like to establish a playful domain that exhibits many of the same real-world problems we face today. It will be a completely runnable API/application that exhibits what I believe to be high standards of software development, and is something I will keep consistent with the tenants espoused by my writings here.

My goal would be to always have _real, usable_ code to point to, and more than one example to showcase in my writings.

### Testing
- Discussing unit/integration/e2e tests from the perspective of cost-value and maintenance
- Strategies for unit testing pure and impure code, with and without external dependencies
- Strategies for writing fast integration testssssss

### Code Organization
- Vertical slice architecture 
- A case for large files (> 1 class per file)
- Reducing project bloat
- Separate data & behavior (both definition and access)

### Data Access
- Entity Framework usage & optimizations

### AI
_I promise I'm not a fanatic, but I'm also not against its responsible inclusion_

- How I personally use it
- Experiences trying to create an agentic SDLC at work

### Game Development
- Dev log of a game I'm building
